	// Defining the variables all at once
	let fruits, text, fLen, i;
	// Then assigning values to each of them
	fruits = ['Banana', 'Orange', 'Apple', 'Mango'];
	// This says - count the # of values in the fruits array (4)
	fLen = fruits.length;
	
	// Now let's assign an initial value of '<ul>' to text, this is the HTML
	// element for an unordered list
	text = '<ul>';
	// Now, let's initialize the loop (set a starting value) with 0 (i=0)
	// Next, we need an exit condition, meaning: stop the loop when x happens,
	// in this case, the loop will continue UNTIL it is no longer less than the
	// total length of the fruits array
	// Finally, specify the increment value i++ means to increment by 1 for each loop
	for (i = 0; i < fLen; i++) {
		// Now - you probably have learned that to choose a value in an array,
		// you use its index value (the index value just defines where it is in
		// an array).  The first value in an index is [0], so to choose 'Banana'
		// you could say fruits[0].  Since our loop starts at 0 - this is what
		// it's doing on the first run through.  Then - it increments by 1 and 
		// looks at fruits[1] (Orange)
		text += '<li>' + fruits[i] + '</li>';
		// text += is just a way of saying to append each new value to the text variable
	}

	text += '<ul>';

	// This is what pushes the text value to the HTML element (so it appears on the page)
